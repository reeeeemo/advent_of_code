# Advent of Code Submissions

All of my submissions for AoC. Note that inputs have been omitted.

# How to run

- Create an `/inputs` folder for each `day_#` folder.
- Download your own puzzle inputs, put them in `/inputs`
- Rename them accordingly, as well as adjust names in the CmakeLists.txt

##  If using Visual Studio:

- Just open, and run the `day_#.exe`.

## If using CMake directly:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
